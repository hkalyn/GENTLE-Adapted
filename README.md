# GENTLE-Adapted-source-code-for-the-Graphical-Ego-Network-Tool-for-Longitudinal-Examination-
This repository contains an adapted version of the GENTLE software (Krause &amp; Jeronimus, 2019), originally developed as a Graphical Ego-Network Tool for Longitudinal Examination. The present version has been modified to support our study of the ego-centric networks of academic trainees in Canada.
